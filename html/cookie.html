      <h2>Our Cookie Policy (We Eat Them... and More)</h2>
      <p>At Ergo-no, your privacy is our top priority, which is why we make sure to keep it as interesting as possible. This policy is here to clarify everything and nothing about how we use cookies, what we do with your data, and how you can try (and fail) to avoid it.</p>
      
      <h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
      <p>Cookies are tiny, delicious files that sneak onto your device the moment you visit our site. They help us remember everything you do, everywhere you go, and every preference you never set. They also make our website run, or at least that's what we tell ourselves.</p>
      
      <h3>How Ergo-no Uses Cookies</h3>
      <p>When you use and access the Service, we may or may not place a number of cookie files in your browser. These cookies serve a variety of mysterious purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Absolutely vital for making sure you can't escape our site without leaving a trace.</li>
        <li><strong>Account-Related Cookies:</strong> Used to remember your login, logout, and everything in between, even if you never logged in.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Help us analyze your every move, click, and hesitation, so we can optimize your experience for our benefit.</li>
        <li><strong>Experimental Cookies:</strong> Sometimes we just like to see what happens. You might never notice, or you might notice too late.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Third-Party Cookies</h3>
      <p>We may allow third parties to place cookies on your device. We don't know what they do with them, but we're sure it's all in your best interest. If you see ads for things you only thought about, that's probably just a coincidence.</p>
      
      <h3>Your Choices Regarding Cookies</h3>
      <p>If you wish to avoid cookies, you can try disabling them in your browser. Results may vary. Some features may stop working, or start working in new and exciting ways. Deleting cookies may also delete your sense of security.</p>
      
      <h3>Further Information About Cookies</h3>
